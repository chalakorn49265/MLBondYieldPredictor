BondYieldPrediction-ML

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting bond yields using a machine learning approach. The project involves feature selection through Lasso Regression and the application of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict bond yields over various time horizons (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 days).

The primary goal of this project is to forecast bond yields by leveraging machine learning techniques. The project workflow involves the following key steps:

	1.	Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the dataset.
	2.	Feature Selection: Utilizing Lasso Regression to identify the most important features.
	3.	Modeling: Building and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict bond yields for the next 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days.
	4.	Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
